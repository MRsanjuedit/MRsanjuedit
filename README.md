# 👋 Hey, I’m Mojesh!

Welcome to my corner of GitHub 👨‍💻  
I’m a **Backend Developer | Web3 Engineer | Builder in Progress** —  
writing code that scales, solves real-world problems, and sometimes even makes me feel smarter than my debugger. 😎

---

## 🚀 About Me

💻 **Tech I Use**: Backend with Java & Spring Boot, Web3 with Solidity, frontend sprinkles with Next.js & JS  
📚 **Currently Exploring**: Voice-first AI apps 🎙️, decentralized infra 🌐, and minimalism in code ✨  
🛠️ **What I Build**: Secure tools, offline-first AI assistants, and dev utilities I wish existed yesterday  
😂 **Fun Fact**: I spent 2 hours naming a variable... it’s still called `temp` 🤷‍♂️
