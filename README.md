# 👋 Hey there, I'm Mojesh!

Welcome to my GitHub corner of the universe!  
I'm a **Backend Developer 🧑‍💻 | Web3 Engineer ⛓️ | Problem-Solver in Progress 🔧**  
by day—and a **curious builder, code philosopher, and lifelong learner 🌱** by night.

I craft systems that scale, code that lasts, and ideas that aim to make me irreplaceable — even by the smartest AI. 😌

## 🚀 About Me

💻 **Currently coding in**: `Java ☕`, `Python 🐍`, `JavaScript ⚡`, `Solidity 🧱`, `Next.js 🌐`, `Spring Boot 🌿`  
📚 **Learning**: Whisper-free voice apps 🗣️, decentralized infra for real-world use 🌍, and how not to over-engineer 😅  
🛠️ **Building**:
- `E&DaaS` 🔐 – Encryption & Decryption as a Service, focused on user-side privacy
- `Hey Mojo` 🎙️ – Offline Voice Assistant with hotkeys and whisper-free wake-word magic
- `BYOD CLI` 🧰 – Bring Your Own Database: flexible tooling for backend devs who know what they want  
😄 **Fun fact**: I once spent 2 hours naming a variable because naming things is harder than writing code 🧠

## 😎 Why Stick Around?

If you're into clean architecture 🏗️, thoughtful solutions 💡, and projects that solve real-world pain (with a pinch of personality), you're in the right place.

Let’s learn, build, and solve together — not just to ship, but to grow.  
Because I’m not just here to code — I’m here to **create with purpose**.
